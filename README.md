# NYC-Subway-Performance-EDA
An exploratory analysis of NYC Subway reliability leveraging MTA customer journey metrics. Utilizing R and statistical modeling, this study investigates the impact of peak-hour demand and platform/train delays on overall journey performance.

# The Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the **MTA Subway Customer Journey-Focused Metrics (2020-2024)**.
* **Source:** [MTA Subway Customer Journey-Focused Metrics 2020-2024](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mta-subway-customer-journey-focused-metrics-beginning-2020)

# Tools & Technologies
**Language:** R

**Libraries:** tidyverse (dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for data visualization)

**Statistical Methods:** Hypothesis Testing (Welch Two Sample T-Tests) and Linear Regression Modeling


# Key Findings
**Ridership Recovery:** Analysis shows a resilient upward trend in monthly ridership from 2021 through 2024 following the sharp decline caused by the 2020 pandemic.

**Operational Reliability:** Statistical testing confirms that Peak hours maintain a significantly higher median performance score (approx. 86.6%) compared to Off-Peak hours (approx. 84.3%), suggesting prioritized service dispatching during rush periods.

**Divisional Performance:** A statistically significant reliability gap exists between Division A (Numbered lines) and Division B (Lettered lines), with Division A consistently outperforming Division B.

**The Impact of Delays:** A strong negative correlation (approx. -0.9) exists between delays and performance. Linear regression indicates that every one-minute increase in total delay reduces the performance score by approximately 6.05 percentage points.


# Statistical Model
The final linear regression model generated by this study is:
$$\text{Performance Score} = 0.9467 - 0.0605 \times (\text{Total Delay})$$


# Business Recommendation
Based on the regression results, the MTA should focus on reducing "additional platform time." Since the model shows that fractional increases in wait times have a statistically measurable negative impact on performance scores, small improvements in platform dispatching could lead to significant gains in overall system reliability.
