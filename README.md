# NYC-Subway-Performance-EDA
An exploratory analysis of NYC Subway reliability leveraging MTA customer journey metrics. Utilizing R and statistical modeling, this study investigates the impact of peak-hour demand and platform/train delays on overall journey performance.

# The Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the **MTA Subway Customer Journey-Focused Metrics (2020-2024)**.
* **Source:** [MTA Subway Customer Journey-Focused Metrics 2020-2024](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mta-subway-customer-journey-focused-metrics-beginning-2020)
* **File:** `MTA_Subway_Customer_Journey-Focused_Metrics__2020-2024.csv`

# Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** tidyverse (dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for data visualization)
- **Statistical Methods:** Hypothesis Testing (Welch Two Sample T-Tests) and Linear Regression Modeling

# Project Overview
This project analyzes five years of NYC subway data to understand:
- Post-COVID ridership recovery patterns
- Performance differences between peak and off-peak periods
- Operational variations across subway divisions (A vs. B)
- The relationship between delays and journey performance

# Key Findings

1. Ridership Recovery
The subway system has shown steady recovery from the 2020 pandemic decline, with ridership progressively increasing from 2021-2024.

2. Peak vs. Off-Peak Performance
Peak hours: 86.6% average performance
Off-peak hours: 84.3% average performance
Statistical significance: p < 0.001 (significant difference exists)

3. Division Performance Gap
Division A: 89.0% average performance
Division B: 83.7% average performance
Difference: 5.3 percentage points (p < 0.001)

4. Delay Impact
Correlation: -0.79 (strong negative relationship)
Regression model: Performance = 0.9467 - 0.0605 × (Total Delay)
R²: 62.3% of performance variation explained by delays

5. Lowest Performing Lines
Lines B, D, Q, M, and R consistently perform below the system average.

# Statistical Model
The final linear regression model generated by this study is:
$$\text{Performance Score} = 0.9467 - 0.0605 \times (\text{Total Delay})$$

# Business Recommendations

1. **Division B Operational Review** - Investigate the 5.3 percentage point performance gap
2. **Peak-Hour Optimization** - Address capacity constraints during high-traffic periods
3. **Targeted Line Improvements** - Focus resources on the bottom 5 performing lines
4. **Delay Reduction Initiative** - Reducing delays by just 0.5 minutes (30 seconds) could improve performance by 3 percentage points

## Impact Scenario
If we reduce average delays by 0.5 minutes:

Performance improvement: 3 percentage points
Example: A line at 85% performance increases to 88% performance
System-wide impact on millions of daily riders
